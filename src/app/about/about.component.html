              <h2 class="text-center">Hi, this is Adri. Nice to meet you.</h2>
              <div class="text-center my-description">
                <p> My name is <b> Adri√†</b>, I am a junior <b> web developer in Angular</b>. I always liked programming. Still remember the first web site 
                  I tried to build, there were not even the half tools nowadays we have. Under my point of view programming is amazing, bugs challenge you
                  to program efficiently in other words: less and better. When I discovered Angular I wanted to know more about. Learning is hard, but when 
                  you start to know... aaah, it changes everything and it makes you life simple. I like to work hard on my projects, they must be perfect!
                  at the moment <b>patience</b>, <b>perseverance</b>, <b>hard Work</b>  and google, are my partners in this journey.
                  A journey full of <b> challenges</b> and unknowns. A journey which I am pleased to be aboard!</p>
