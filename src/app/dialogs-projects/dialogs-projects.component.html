                <p> Angular Hero Battle is one of the projects I enjoyed the most. It was a project plenty of challenges and I would not be lying if I say that 
                    I thought about dropping out the project a few times and think of an easier one. Nowadays, after hard working on it, I can say that I am proud of 
                    this project which has a lot of potential. <br>
                    The <b>problem solving</b> and being  <b>persistent</b> were the key to develop this player versus player card game. I may say that apart of being 
                    proud of Angular Hero Battle, it helped me to understand how <b>Angular</b> works and learn a lot about this amazing framework.

                    This project is not the hardest I worked on. Everything was smooth until the animations dropped by. The animations of this project were the one which
                    made me struggle. I have worked with animations before, but never made such animations with plenty of conditions on the back. <br>
                    Thanks to my <b>creativity</b> I was able to develop a simple game which may not be that easy to get more than 100k points. Don't believe so? 
                    I dare you to beat my record: 110.250

                <p> This project was the one which taught me how to use <b>TypeScript</b> and its classes. 
                    At the begining was quite hard to keep the type of each variable. After that was when I undestood
                    why TypeScript is important. Since then TypeScript is always present in my codes.

                <p> One of my firsts projects with Java Script which I am really proud of. 
                    It was really hard to understand the language, but once undestood how JS was working, 
                    the whole world of posibilities that JS offers you opened up right infront of me. 
                    Nowadays JavaScript stills being one of the languages I enjoy the most.
